🌍 SDG 3: Cancer Prediction Project — Executive Summary

🎥 Presentation Video: Watch Here

Project Overview

Sustainable Development Goal: SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-being
Focus Area: Cancer outcome prediction and early detection using AI
Approach: Supervised Machine Learning (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks)
Dataset: Cancer patient data including demographics, lifestyle, and medical history

Cancer remains a leading global cause of death. This project leverages AI to enhance early detection, risk assessment, and data-driven healthcare decisions, directly contributing to UN SDG 3.

Technical Implementation

Data Processing: Cleaned, encoded, and standardized dataset for model readiness

Model Development: Trained and compared four supervised ML algorithms using cross-validation

Performance Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix

Feature Analysis: Identified major predictors — age, cancer stage, and chronic illnesses

This pipeline ensures predictive accuracy, interpretability, and fairness across diverse patient demographics.

Key Results

🧠 Best Model: Random Forest — 85%+ accuracy

💡 Survival Rate: 70% overall within dataset

🔍 Top Predictors: Age, cancer stage, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease

❤️ Impact: Potential to save 150+ lives via early detection — a 15% improvement in outcomes

The results demonstrate AI’s tangible potential to reduce mortality and guide smarter healthcare strategies.

Ethical & Responsible AI

Bias Evaluation: Tested performance across gender, age, and cancer types

Fairness Validation: Comparable accuracy across population subgroups

Data Privacy: Maintained anonymization and secure handling

Human Oversight: Ensures doctors remain the final decision-makers

This responsible design promotes fair, transparent, and trustworthy AI in healthcare.
